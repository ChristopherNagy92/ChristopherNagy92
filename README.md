- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChristopherNagy92
- 👀 I’m interested in advancing the frontier of emotionally intelligent AI.  My primary focus is on intgrating cutting-edge technologies like emotion ecognition, machine learning, and AI-driven human-machine interactions to create transformative, empathetic solutions that improve lives.  At Axiom Research Labs, we're pioneering EmotionIQ, a technology that blends facial expressions, voice intonations, text analysis, physiological signals, gesture recognition, and contextual data to provide unparalleled insights into human emotion.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AI techniques, especially in the realm of deep learning and cross-modal emotion recognition.  I'm also deepening my knowledge of ethical AI practices to ensure that the technology we create not only pushes boundaries but does so responsibly and inclusively.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that aim to bridge the gap between human emotions and AI.  If you're working on something that involves emotion recognition, AI ethics, or any application where technology meets deep human understanding, I'm eager to collaborate.  Let's push the boundaries of what's possible together.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Before diving into the world of AI and technology, I started my career with an undergraduate degree in music education and composition at Indiana University.  This unique journey has given me a deep appreciation for the arts and the science of human emotion, which now fuels my work in creating emotionally intelligent AI.
